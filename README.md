# Skitech Team - Hackathon Project

This repository contains the work of the **Skitech Team** for the hackathon.  

Originally, we planned to present our work as a website using a FastAPI backend. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to complete the website. Instead, all our work is presented in a **Jupyter notebook**:

- **Hackathon_jupyter.ipynb** – Contains data processing, AI model training, visualization, and analysis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need Python 3.10+ and the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib folium requests notebook
